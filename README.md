# Display_Formatted_ResultSet
The purpose of this static class is to display the contents of a ResultSet formatted. The format in which the contents are printed can be passed in via the print method, specified through an Enum, or omitted. In the case of omission, an overloaded print method will be used and a default format will be used. This default format can be set.
